# practice-about-the-use-Opengl-and-freeglut
This little project was a practice about transformation with vectors and matrix in 3D objects implement for the Computer graphics class at the period 2019-1.
 This projects was implemented with out objects orientation, the reason for that was the hard logic on the use of freeglut library, and with out high experience, the objects implementations were not viable.
